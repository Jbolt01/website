# Designers and Developers

If you  are interested in designing or developing with us, you can reach to us through the [ML Club Discord](https://discord.gg/Usz9UXbQNy) which we check regularly.

## Scripts

Make sure you have nodejs and yarn installed. Install dependencies with:

```bash
yarn
```

Once it's done start up a local server with:

```bash
yarn start
```

In order to build for deploy:
```bash
yarn build
```
